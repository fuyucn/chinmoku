# Web Performance Optimization Strategies

Performance is crucial for user experience and SEO. Let's explore key strategies to make your web applications lightning fast.

## Core Web Vitals

Focus on three key metrics:

- **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint): < 2.5s
- **FID** (First Input Delay): < 100ms
- **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift): < 0.1

## Code Splitting

Split your JavaScript bundles to load only what's needed:

```typescript
const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import('./HeavyComponent'), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>
})
```

## Image Optimization

Use next-gen formats and lazy loading:

```jsx
<Image
  src="/photo.jpg"
  alt="Optimized"
  width={800}
  height={600}
  loading="lazy"
/>
```

## Caching Strategies

Implement effective caching headers:

```typescript
export const revalidate = 3600 // Revalidate every hour
```

## Minimize Third-Party Scripts

Audit and reduce external dependencies that slow down your site.

## Bundle Size Analysis

Regular check your bundle size:

```bash
npm run build -- --analyze
```

Performance optimization is an ongoing process. Measure, optimize, and repeat!
