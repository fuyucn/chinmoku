# 10 Tailwind CSS Tips for Better Styling

Tailwind CSS has revolutionized how we style web applications. Here are some practical tips to make the most of this utility-first framework.

## 1. Use the @apply Directive Wisely

Extract common patterns into custom classes when needed:

```css
.btn-primary {
  @apply px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded hover:bg-blue-600;
}
```

## 2. Leverage Arbitrary Values

Use square brackets for one-off custom values:

```html
<div class="top-[117px] left-[50%]">
  Content
</div>
```

## 3. Mobile-First Responsive Design

Start with mobile styles and use breakpoints to scale up:

```html
<div class="text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg">
  Responsive text
</div>
```

## 4. Group Hover and Focus States

```html
<div class="group">
  <img class="group-hover:scale-110 transition" />
</div>
```

## 5. Dark Mode Support

```html
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900">
  Adaptive content
</div>
```

These techniques will help you write cleaner, more maintainable Tailwind code.
