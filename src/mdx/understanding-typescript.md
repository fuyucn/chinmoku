# Understanding TypeScript for Modern Development

TypeScript has become an essential tool for building robust JavaScript applications. Let's dive into why it matters and how to use it effectively.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, catching errors before runtime and improving code quality through better IDE support and refactoring capabilities.

### Benefits

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time
- **Better IntelliSense**: Enhanced autocomplete and documentation
- **Refactoring**: Safely rename and restructure code
- **Documentation**: Types serve as inline documentation

## Basic Types

```typescript
let message: string = "Hello, TypeScript!"
let count: number = 42
let isActive: boolean = true
```

## Interfaces and Types

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number
  name: string
  email: string
}

type Status = 'active' | 'inactive' | 'pending'
```

TypeScript makes your code more maintainable and scalable.
